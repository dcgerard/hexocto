Takes the code from Wang et al. (2021) and Wang et al. (2022) and places
it in package form so that it is easier to compare. I would not
recommend using this package for real work. You should use the
[`{hwep}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hwep) package from Gerard
(2021).

The original repos with the original code are
<https://github.com/CCBBeijing/hexaploid> and
<https://github.com/CCBBeijing/OctoploidDeer>.

If those repos are ever deleted or made private, you can see my forks at
<https://github.com/dcgerard/hexaploid> and
<https://github.com/dcgerard/OctoploidDeer>.

## Installation

You can install `{hexocto}` using the `{devtools}` package

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dcgerard/hexocto")
```
