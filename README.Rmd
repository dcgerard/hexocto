# hexocto

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Takes the code from @wang2021tracing and @wang2022asymptotic and places it in package form so that it is easier to compare. I would not recommend using this package for real work. You should use the [`{hwep}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hwep) package from @gerard2021double.

## Installation

You can install `{hexocto}` using the `{devtools}` package

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dcgerard/hexocto")
```
